The repo contains the notebook files, data set, and submissions for HackerEarth's Pet Adoption challenge.
It helps you learn Python's Scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib library for machine learning, typically the concepts like train test data split, loading csv data, exploring data, generating more features, training decision tree models, support vecotr machines, etc and finally saving the model for later use and making predictions using trained model, plotting confusion matrix, etc.
